## Introduction to Algorithms <a name="1"></a>
* Software Development Projects
   * Design Phase
      * Cannot create something on trial and error basis.
      * **Write in easy, english-like syntax.**
   * Implementation Phase
* Algorithms vs. Program
   1. Algorithms
      1. Written during the **design phase**.
      2. Written by someone with knowledge of subject. 
         1. Ex. statistician on EM algorithm
      3. Written in any language 
         1. English or mathematical notations.
         2. **Mathematical notations is best.**
      4. Hardware and software independent.
      5. Analyze and optimize for time and space.
   2. Programs
      1. Written during the **implementation phase**.
      2. Written by a programmer.
      3. Written in a programming language.
      4. Hardware and software dependent. 
         1. Questions like what OS will it run on and with what computer specs will need to be considered.
      5. Test it.
